                    A wedding reception is a party usually held after the completion of a marriage ceremony
                    as hospitality for those who have attended the wedding, hence the name reception:
                    the couple receive society, in the form of family and friends, for the first time
                    as a married couple. Hosts provide their choice of food and drink, although a wedding
                    cake is popular. Entertaining guests after a wedding ceremony is traditional in
                    most societies, and can last anywhere from half an hour to many hours or even days.
                    Most wedding receptions are made in the evening for dinner however, the couple may
                    opt for a luncheon, brunch, or even afternoon tea.[1] Ultimately the married couple
                    chooses the details and location of the reception.</h3>
