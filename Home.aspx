                    A wedding ceremony consists of many events. They are starting from wedding rehearsal
                    dinner, wedding to wedding reception. All these involve guests, friends and family.
                    All in all, it is a big picture of wedding. As the event is big, the responsibilities
                    are bigger. The bride and groom have lot of expectations from the event and especially
                    from the event manager. In order to arranging a successful wedding event, managing
                    all of the events is very important. We agree it is a huge responsibility. But it
                    comes with lot of satisfaction also. Being an essential part of someone’s most special
                    moments will give we immense pleasure. our work will be satisfactory when we will
