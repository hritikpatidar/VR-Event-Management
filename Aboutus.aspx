                This is the home of the Event Tech Brief email newsletter. It was developed with
                three goals in mind: to assist event producers tasked with understanding the technology
                that powers events, create a neutral, no spin zone where the technology can be dissected
                and reviewed, and deliver the information that the event community needs to move
                events into the future. <br /><br />Every issue will contain articles about new event-industry
                technology, but we won’t stop there. Event Tech Brief will also give you resources
                and tools for decision-making and fill you in on what it’s like to implement the
                solutions in the event environment.<br /><br /> This publication is and always will be a reflection
                of where events need to go. We will look beyond events to see what we can bring
                from the outside in. We’ll look at trade shows, meetings, conferences, festivals
                and public exhibitions to see what can be cross-pollinated across the industry.
